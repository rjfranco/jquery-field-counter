# jQuery Field Counter
## A plugin to count and limit the amount of characters typed into a textarea

Useage once completed should be pretty straight forward, something along the lines of:

```javascript
$('#some-textarea').counter('140');
```

This should limit the amount of allowed character to 140, and create a span above the element that counts how many characters you have left.
